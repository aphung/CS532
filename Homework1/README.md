Homework 1: Bresenham's Line Algorithm

* Expand Bresenham's Line Algorithm in OpenGL to plot a line using setPixel(x, y) function given earlier to draw a line between given  
    Start point (x0, y0)
    And end point (x1,y1)

* Make it work in any quadrant (with any slope m<1 and m>1). 

* You would need just slightly to modify the code after you work out the math.
